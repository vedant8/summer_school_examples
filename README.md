# Summer School Examples
This repository is a collection of coding examples for the IceCube Summer School.

# Using GitHub
GitHub is a way to track changes and edits to code, as well as to collaborate on a code. 

To use this repository, you can `clone` it into a folder on your `scratch` directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/jessiethw/summer_school_examples.git
```

You will then have your own copy of the code in a folder called `summer_school_examples`. We will go through each example and answers during the Summer School. You should try to complete the exercises without looking at the answers, until we go through the answers together.
